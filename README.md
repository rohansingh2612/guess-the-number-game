# Number Guessing Game

A simple command-line number guessing game implemented in C. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. It provides hints ("LOWER NUMBER PLEASE" or "HIGHER NUMBER PLEASE") based on the user's guesses and congratulates when the correct number is guessed.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system. If not, you can install GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) which is commonly used.
- Optionally, you can use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for ease of development.

# For Experiencing the project

DOWNLOAD `main.c` and then run it with vscode by entering the following command in terminal:

STEP 1:
```bash
gcc main.c
```
STEP 2:
```bash
/a.exe 
```
# Usage

1.  The game will generate a random number between 1 and 100.
2.  Enter your guesses when prompted.
3.  Based on your guesses, the program will respond with "LOWER NUMBER PLEASE" or "HIGHER NUMBER PLEASE".
4.  When you guess the correct number, the program will congratulate you and display the number of guesses it took.

# Features

1.  Generates a random number between 1 and 100 for the user to guess.
2.  Provides feedback based on whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the random number.
3.  Counts the number of guesses taken to find the correct number.
4.  Simple and efficient implementation in C.
